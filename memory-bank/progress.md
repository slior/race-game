# Progress Report

## What Works
*   The project has been initialized with Vite and `npm`.
*   All dependencies (`lit-html`, `jest`, `eslint`, etc.) are installed.
*   The initial directory structure (`src/engine`, `src/ui`) has been created.
*   Core type definitions have been added to `src/types.ts`.
*   The development environment is confirmed to be working with `npm run dev`.
*   The Jest testing environment is fully configured and operational.
*   The core `Deck` manager (`src/engine/deck.ts`) is implemented and fully unit-tested. This includes logic for creating, shuffling, and drawing cards.
*   The core Player and Turn managers (`src/engine/game.ts`) are implemented and fully unit-tested. This includes logic for creating a game state, applying card effects, advancing turns, and checking win conditions.
*   **A basic AI opponent is implemented (`src/engine/ai.ts`) using a Strategy pattern.** This includes a balanced `HeuristicStrategy` and an `AggressorStrategy`, both of which are fully unit-tested.

## What's Left to Build
*   **UI Layer**: All visual components (`BoardView`, `HandView`, etc.).
*   **State & Storage**: URL-based state serialization and deserialization.
*   **Testing**: Unit tests for state storage logic.
*   **Documentation**: User and developer guides.

## Current Status
*   **Overall**: The core game engine logic, including a functional AI, is complete and stable.
*   **Next**: Implement the state persistence layer.

## Known Issues
*   None. The initial setup is stable.
