# Progress Report

## What Works
*   The project has been initialized with Vite and `npm`.
*   All dependencies (`lit-html`, `jest`, `eslint`, etc.) are installed.
*   The initial directory structure (`src/engine`, `src/ui`) has been created.
*   Core type definitions have been added to `src/types.ts`.
*   The development environment is confirmed to be working with `npm run dev`.

## What's Left to Build
*   **Game Engine**: Deck management, player state, turn logic, and AI.
*   **UI Layer**: All visual components (`BoardView`, `HandView`, etc.).
*   **State & Storage**: URL-based state serialization.
*   **Testing**: Unit tests for game logic and AI.
*   **Documentation**: User and developer guides.

## Current Status
*   **Overall**: Technical setup is complete.
*   **Next**: Implement the `Deck` manager in `src/engine/deck.ts`.

## Known Issues
*   None. The initial setup is stable. A previous `crypto.hash` error was resolved by upgrading the Node.js version to the latest LTS release.
