# Progress Report

## What Works
*   The project has been initialized with Vite and `npm`.
*   All dependencies (`lit-html`, `jest`, `eslint`, etc.) are installed.
*   The initial directory structure (`src/engine`, `src/ui`) has been created.
*   Core type definitions have been added to `src/types.ts`.
*   The development environment is confirmed to be working with `npm run dev`.
*   The Jest testing environment is fully configured and operational.
*   The core `Deck` manager (`src/engine/deck.ts`) is implemented and fully unit-tested. This includes logic for creating, shuffling, and drawing cards.
*   The core Player and Turn managers (`src/engine/game.ts`) are implemented and fully unit-tested. This includes logic for creating a game state, applying card effects, advancing turns, and checking win conditions.
*   **A basic AI opponent is implemented (`src/engine/ai.ts`) using a Strategy pattern.** This includes a balanced `HeuristicStrategy` and an `AggressorStrategy`, both of which are fully unit-tested.
*   **The core engine has been refactored to use type-safe constants and helper functions**, eliminating magic strings and improving maintainability.
*   **State & Storage**: URL-based state serialization (`encodeState`) and deserialization (`decodeState`) is implemented and unit-tested.
*   **UI Layer**: The entire UI layer is now implemented. This includes the `PlayerView`, `HandView`, `LogView`, and `ControlsView`. A central `App` component manages state and orchestrates all UI rendering and interactions, including targeting logic for block cards.
*   **UI Enhancements**: The UI has been improved to provide clearer state visibility. A "go" indicator now appears on a player's view when they can play progress cards. The layout has been updated to show the current player's hand directly beneath their player area, creating a more intuitive flow.
*   **Rule Enforcement**: The game's core rules are now robustly enforced by a central `isCardPlayable` helper function and have been validated with an extensive test suite.
*   **Configurable Player Count**: The game now supports a configurable player count (2-4 players). This can be set via a new UI input or by using the `playerCount` URL query parameter.

## What's Left to Build
*   **Documentation**: User and developer guides.
*   **Testing**: End-to-end tests for the complete user flow.

## Recent Bug Fixes
*   **Green Light Prerequisite**: Fixed a bug where the rule requiring a "Green Light" before playing progress cards was not enforced.
*   **Initial Green Light Play**: Fixed a bug that prevented players from playing their initial "Green Light" card if they were not blocked.
*   **Block Card Playability**: Fixed a UI bug where the "Play Card" button was incorrectly disabled for block cards.
*   **Progress While Blocked**: Fixed a bug that allowed players to play progress cards while under the effect of a block card.
*   **Test Suite Mocks**: Updated all mock objects in the unit test suites to include the new `isReady` property on the `PlayerState` interface, resolving all test failures.
*   **Repair Card Logic**: Fixed a bug where the "Repair" card was misconfigured to fix a "Flat Tire" instead of an "Accident", preventing players from playing it correctly.

## Current Status
*   **Overall**: The game is feature-complete and highly stable after a series of significant bug fixes. The core engine, state persistence, and a fully interactive UI are all implemented and integrated.
*   **Next**: Write comprehensive documentation and consider end-to-end testing.

## Known Issues
*   None. The application is stable.
