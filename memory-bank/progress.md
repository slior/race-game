# Progress Report

## What Works
*   The project has been initialized with Vite and `npm`.
*   All dependencies (`lit-html`, `jest`, `eslint`, etc.) are installed.
*   The initial directory structure (`src/engine`, `src/ui`) has been created.
*   Core type definitions have been added to `src/types.ts`.
*   The development environment is confirmed to be working with `npm run dev`.
*   **The Jest testing environment is fully configured and operational.**
*   **The core `Deck` manager (`src/engine/deck.ts`) is implemented and fully unit-tested.** This includes logic for creating, shuffling, and drawing cards.

## What's Left to Build
*   **Game Engine**: Player state management, turn logic, and AI.
*   **UI Layer**: All visual components (`BoardView`, `HandView`, etc.).
*   **State & Storage**: URL-based state serialization.
*   **Testing**: Unit tests for the game logic and AI.
*   **Documentation**: User and developer guides.

## Current Status
*   **Overall**: The foundational game engine work has begun.
*   **Next**: Implement the Player and Turn Manager in `src/engine/game.ts`.

## Known Issues
*   None. The initial setup is stable.
