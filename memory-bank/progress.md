# Progress Report

## What Works
*   The project has been initialized with Vite and `npm`.
*   All dependencies (`lit-html`, `jest`, `eslint`, etc.) are installed.
*   The initial directory structure (`src/engine`, `src/ui`) has been created.
*   Core type definitions have been added to `src/types.ts`.
*   The development environment is confirmed to be working with `npm run dev`.
*   The Jest testing environment is fully configured and operational.
*   The core `Deck` manager (`src/engine/deck.ts`) is implemented and fully unit-tested. This includes logic for creating, shuffling, and drawing cards.
*   The core Player and Turn managers (`src/engine/game.ts`) are implemented and fully unit-tested. This includes logic for creating a game state, applying card effects, advancing turns, and checking win conditions.
*   **A basic AI opponent is implemented (`src/engine/ai.ts`) using a Strategy pattern.** This includes a balanced `HeuristicStrategy` and an `AggressorStrategy`, both of which are fully unit-tested.
*   **The core engine has been refactored to use type-safe constants and helper functions**, eliminating magic strings and improving maintainability.
*   **State & Storage**: URL-based state serialization (`encodeState`) and deserialization (`decodeState`) is implemented and unit-tested.
*   **UI Layer**: The entire UI layer is now implemented. This includes the `BoardView`, `HandView`, `LogView`, and `ControlsView`. A central `App` component manages state and orchestrates all UI rendering and interactions, including targeting logic for block cards.

## What's Left to Build
*   **Documentation**: User and developer guides.
*   **Testing**: End-to-end tests for the complete user flow.

## Current Status
*   **Overall**: The game is now feature-complete and playable. The core engine, state persistence, and a fully interactive UI are all implemented and integrated.
*   **Next**: Write comprehensive documentation and consider end-to-end testing.

## Known Issues
*   None. The application is stable.
