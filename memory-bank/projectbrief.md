# Project Brief: RACE Card Game

This project is to build a digital version of a card game called "RACE". The objective of the game is to be the first player to accumulate 1000 km of progress.

It is a turn-based game for 2-4 players. The game involves drawing and playing cards, which can be progress, block, remedy, or immunity cards.

The application will be a web-based game implemented in TypeScript, with a vanilla JS and lit-html frontend.
