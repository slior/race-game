# Active Context: Project Initialization

The current focus is on bootstrapping the "RACE" game project. The foundational planning documents (`project-plan.md` and `game-instructions.md`) have been reviewed, and the Memory Bank has just been initialized.

## Current Goal
The immediate goal is to establish the project structure as outlined in `project-plan.md`. This involves:
1.  Initializing an `npm` project with Vite.
2.  Installing all required dependencies (`lit-html`, `jest`, `eslint`, etc.).
3.  Creating the initial directory structure (`src/`, `src/engine`, `src/ui`, etc.).
4.  Defining the core TypeScript types in `src/types.ts`.

## Next Steps
1.  Execute the `npm init` command.
2.  Run `npm install` for all dependencies.
3.  Create the folder and file structure.
4.  Populate `src/types.ts` with the initial type definitions.

This will lay the groundwork for implementing the game engine and UI components.
