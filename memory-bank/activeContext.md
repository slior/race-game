# Active Context: State Persistence

The core game logic and a functional AI opponent are now complete and fully tested. The AI was implemented using a Strategy Pattern to allow for different, interchangeable "personalities" like a balanced `HeuristicStrategy` and an `AggressorStrategy`.

## Current Goal
With the game engine and AI in place, the focus now shifts entirely to developing the state serialization mechanism.

## Next Steps
1.  **Implement State Serialization** (`src/state/storage.ts`): Create the functions to encode the `GameState` object into a Base64 string for URL persistence and decode it back on page load.
2.  **Write Unit Tests**: Create Jest tests for the state serialization logic.

This phase will complete the core engine and persistence layers, making the game fully playable from end-to-end (via state manipulation), albeit without a UI.
