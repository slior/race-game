# Active Context: UI Development

The core game engine, AI, and state persistence layers are now complete and fully tested. The game is functionally playable from end-to-end via state manipulation and URL sharing.

## Current Goal
The focus now shifts to the final major component: the **UI Layer**. This involves creating all the visual elements required for a user to interact with the game in the browser.

## Next Steps
1.  **Implement `BoardView`**: Create the component to display each player's name, total distance, and cards in play (blocks and immunities).
2.  **Implement `HandView`**: Create the component to display the current player's hand of cards.
3.  **Implement `LogView`**: Create a component to show a running list of game events.
4.  **Implement `Controls`**: Create the UI buttons for primary game actions like "Play Card" and "Discard".
5.  **Integrate Views**: Assemble all UI components into a main application view that reads from the `GameState` and re-renders on change.
