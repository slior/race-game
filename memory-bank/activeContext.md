# Active Context: UI Enhancements and Documentation

The main development phase is complete, and recent work has focused on improving the user interface for better clarity and usability. A "go" indicator has been added to show player readiness, and the hand of the current player is now displayed more intuitively. The game is feature-complete and stable, with the entire test suite passing after being updated to reflect the latest changes.

## Current Goal
The focus is on project finalization. This involves ensuring the project is well-documented and robust.

## Next Steps
1.  **Documentation**: Write comprehensive user and developer guides to ensure the project is understandable and maintainable.
2.  **Testing**: Consider adding end-to-end tests to validate the full user interaction flow from starting a game to winning.
