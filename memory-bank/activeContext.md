# Active Context: UI Development

The core game engine, AI, and state persistence layers are now complete and fully tested. The engine has also been significantly refactored to enforce type safety by using constants instead of string literals, making the system more robust and maintainable.

## Current Goal
The focus now shifts to the final major component: the **UI Layer**. This involves creating all the visual elements required for a user to interact with the game in the browser.

## Next Steps
1.  **Implement `BoardView`**: Create the component to display each player's name, total distance, and cards in play (blocks and immunities).
2.  **Implement `HandView`**: Create the component to display the current player's hand of cards.
3.  **Implement `LogView`**: Create a component to show a running list of game events.
4.  **Implement `Controls`**: Create the UI buttons for primary game actions like "Play Card" and "Discard".
5.  **Integrate Views**: Assemble all UI components into a main application view that reads from the `GameState` and re-renders on change.
