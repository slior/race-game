# Active Context: Project Robustness and Documentation

The main development phase is complete. The core game engine, state management, and a fully interactive UI layer have been implemented and integrated. A recent phase of intensive bug fixing has significantly improved the stability and correctness of the game's rule enforcement. The game is now feature-complete and stable.

## Current Goal
The focus is on project finalization. This involves ensuring the project is well-documented and robust.

## Next Steps
1.  **Documentation**: Write comprehensive user and developer guides to ensure the project is understandable and maintainable.
2.  **Testing**: Consider adding end-to-end tests to validate the full user interaction flow from starting a game to winning.
