# Active Context: UI Development

The core game engine and the initial `BoardView` UI component are complete. The board is implemented using a composable pattern (`BoardView` -> `PlayerView` -> `CardView`) and uses programmatically generated SVGs for card visuals. The `HandView` has now also been implemented.

## Current Goal
The focus is to continue building the UI Layer by creating the components needed for player interaction.

## Next Steps
1.  **Implement `Controls`**: Create the UI buttons for primary game actions like "Play Card" and "Discard".
2.  **Implement `LogView`**: Create a component to show a running list of game events.
3.  **Integrate Views**: Assemble all UI components into the main application view and connect them to the game engine's state update loop.
