# Active Context: Game Engine AI and State Persistence

The core game logic for managing players and turns is complete and unit-tested. The foundational rules of the game engine are now in place.

## Current Goal
The focus now shifts to two parallel objectives: implementing a basic AI opponent and developing the state serialization mechanism.

## Next Steps
1.  **Implement a Basic AI** (`src/engine/ai.ts`): Develop a simple AI that can analyze the game state and decide which card to play based on a straightforward ruleset.
2.  **Implement State Serialization** (`src/state/storage.ts`): Create the functions to encode the `GameState` object into a Base64 string for URL persistence and decode it back on page load.
3.  **Write Unit Tests**: Create Jest tests for both the AI and state serialization logic.

This phase will complete the core engine and persistence layers, making the game playable from end-to-end, albeit without a UI.
