# Product Context: RACE Game

## 1. Core Experience

RACE is a multiplayer card game where players compete to finish a 1000 km road trip first. The gameplay is straightforward: on each turn, a player draws a card and plays a card. The core loop revolves around balancing making progress on your own journey while strategically hindering opponents.

## 2. Target Audience

This is a casual game for 2-4 players, suitable for ages 8 and up. It's designed to be a light, fun, and competitive experience that can be played in short sessions.

## 3. How It Works

### Game Flow
1.  **Setup**: The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt 5 cards.
2.  **Turns**: Players take turns drawing a card and then playing or discarding one.
3.  **Winning**: The first player to reach 1000 km wins.

### Key Gameplay Elements
*   **Progress Cards**: These cards have kilometer values and are used to advance a player's own score.
*   **Block Cards**: These are played on opponents to impede their progress (e.g., "Red Light", "Flat Tire"). A player cannot play progress cards while blocked.
*   **Remedy Cards**: These are used to cancel out a block card that an opponent has played on you.
*   **Immunity Cards**: These are special cards that provide permanent protection against a specific type of block.
*   **AI Players**: Players can be configured to be controlled by the computer. Different AI "personalities" (e.g., Aggressor, Heuristic) can be chosen, and their moves are automatically played with visual feedback.
*   **Green Light Rule**: A player must play a "Green Light" remedy card before they can play any progress cards.
*   **State Sharing**: The entire game state is encoded in the URL, allowing a game to be shared or resumed simply by sharing the link.
