# RACE: Game Instructions

**Players:** 2–4 (ages 8+)  
**Components (120 cards):**  
- **Progress** cards (25 km, 50 km, 75 km, 100 km, 200 km)  
- **Block** cards  
- **Remedy** cards  
- **Immunity** cards  

---

## Objective  
Be the first to accumulate **1000 km** of progress.

---

## Setup  
1. Shuffle all cards together.  
2. Deal **5 cards** to each player; place the rest face‑down as the **draw pile**.  
3. The player to the dealer’s left goes first; play then proceeds clockwise.

---

## Turn Sequence  
On your turn:  
1. **Draw** one card from the draw pile.  
2. **Play** one card from your hand (or discard one if you cannot play):  
   - **Progress**: Lay a progress card in front of you; its value adds to your total distance.  
   - **Block**: Play on any opponent to stop or slow them.  
   - **Remedy**: Immediately cover a blocking card played against you on a previous turn.  
   - **Immunity**: Play in front of you to permanently protect against one specific block.  
   - **If you cannot play** any of the above: discard any one card, then draw one replacement.  
3. Reshuffle the discard pile into the draw pile if it runs out.

## Special Rules on Progress & Blocking  
1. **Green Light Requirement**  
   - Before you can play *any* progress, you must first have a “Green Light” in front of you.  
2. **Blocked Players**  
   - You cannot play progress while blocked, but you may still play block cards on others.  
3. **Single Block Limit**  
   - You may only have one active block per player at a time (except “Speed Limit,” which can stack).
